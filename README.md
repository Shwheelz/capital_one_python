# capital_one_python
Python wrapper for Capital One's hackathon API

Please note, this is still in the development phase and not yet ready for use.

TODO:
* Finish implementing Account class
* Implement ATM, Bill, Branch, Customer, Deposit, Transaction, and Withdrawal classes
* Clean up code; add inheritance after functionality is finished
* Decide on a test framework and write tests
* Publish to allow people to import the API wrapper for Python projects
